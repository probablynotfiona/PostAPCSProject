**Stage 1:**  Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block!  (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:

- [ ] General description of the goal or purpose.  What are you trying to make happen or solve?  Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.
- natural disaster simulator, takes data from the internet like weather data, history of natural disaster in the area, etc. to predict the likelihood of certain natural disasters like earthquakes, storms, etc. happening in an area, the amount of magnitude, the damage caused, and recommended personell required to fix damage 
- [ ] Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the `main` method exist?  Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
- Potential classes: simulate (where the main class is), graph class (maybe some visualization of the estimated damage caused), natural disasters class, prediction class - simulate would have multiple things that can be entered as parameters like previous data in order to best account for the actual chances of a disaster happening in an area and would have a run method as well as toString methods to show what actually will happen.
- graph class would probably require some extra research into how data visualization works in java
- this would probably require some research into how natural disasters are predicted 
- the prediction class could take math from how statistics predicts likelihood of something and calculate it 
- [ ] New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures.  This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other `class` for your project.
- predicted new code structures: rudimentary graphics in order to create a graph of the likelihood of a natural disaster throughout years, or the damage caused 
- [ ] Division of labor:  who will do what in this project?  Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people?  This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals)
- probably someone needs to figure out how to get graphs to work in java
- someone would need to research into how natural disasters are predicted in real life and compile it
- people would split up different classes to write in terms of predictions ie a different person writes each different method in the natural disaster class depending on the research on how each natural disaster is predicted
